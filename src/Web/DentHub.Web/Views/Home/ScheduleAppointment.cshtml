<h2>How to schedule an appointment?</h2>
</hr>
<div>
<p>If you are a patient, appointments available for booking are visible with status "Offering". Use the Book link next to the desired available appointment. Follow up the status of your booking. Your dentist will move it to status "Confirmed". After that you can no longer cancel your appointment. If you still have a valid reason to cancel your appointment please contact your dentist or his/her clinic directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a dentist, you can add your appointment availability by navigating to Appointmens and clicking <a href="~/Appointment/CreateOffering">Offer an Appointment</a> at the bottom of the page. Once booked by a patient, you can either confirm or cancel the appointment. After confirming an appointment you can no longer cancel it. If you still have a valid reason to cancel your appointment please contact your patient directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a patient sees their dentist, either of them can move appointment status to "Completed".&nbsp;</p>
